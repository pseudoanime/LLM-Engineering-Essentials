## Contents

* **2.1. Structured inputs and outputs (Will be available later)** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.1_structured_inputs_and_outputs.ipynb)

  Structure outputs of an LLM to make parsing and processing easy.

* **2.2. LLM Orchestration** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.2_llm_workflows.ipynb)

  Combine calls to LLMs into complex workflows to solve even more challenging tasks.

* **2.3. Intro to LLM Reasoning** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.3_intro_to_llm_reasoning.ipynb)

  Examine AI reasoning’s strengths and limitations and explore whether LLM "thinking" truly mirrors human cognitive processes.

* **2.4. Inference-Time Compute** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.4_inference_time_compute.ipynb)
  
  Make LLMs more effective with advanced orchestration techniques. Explore how to choose wisely between different approaches — using a larger model or a smaller one with a more sophisticated strategy.

* **2.5. Establishing non-linear reasoning capabilities** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.5_establishing_non_linear_reasoning.ipynb)

  Understand how models like DeepSeek-R1 develop reasoning abilities. Take a closer look at the data collection and training strategies that shape their performance.
  
* **2.6. LLM Tools and Agents** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.6_llm_tools_and_agents.ipynb)

  Learn how LLMs use tools and function calling to extend their capabilities.

* **2.7. Agentic Orchestration** [colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic2/2.7_agentic_orchestration.ipynb)

  Advance past manual LLM orchestration and start designing AI-driven workflows.
